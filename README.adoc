A https://github.com/features/actions[GitHub Action] to easily set up and use a chroot-based footnote:[If you don’t know what https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot[chroot] is, think of it as a very simple container. It’s one of the cornerstones of containers and the only one that is actually needed for this use case.] https://alpinelinux.org/[Alpine Linux] environment in your workflows and emulate any supported CPU architecture (using QEMU).

_See <<examples, more examples>>…_


== Highlights

* *Easy to use and flexible*
** Add one _step_ `uses: {action-ref}` to set up the Alpine environment, for the next steps that should run in this environment, specify `shell: alpine.sh {0}`. See <<examples>> for more.
** You can switch between one, or even more, Alpine environments and the host system (Ubuntu) within a single _job_ (i.e. each _step_ can run in a different environment). This is ideal, for example, for <<cross-compile-rust, cross-compilations>>.

* *Emulation of non-x86 architectures*
** This couldn’t be easier; just specify input parameter <<arch>>. The _action_ sets up QEMU user space emulator and installs Alpine Linux environment for the specified architecture. You can then build and run binaries for/from this architecture, just like on real hardware, but (significantly) slower (it’s a software _emulation_ after all).

* *No hassle with Docker images*
** You don’t have to write any Dockerfiles, for example, to cross-compile Rust crates with C dependencies.footnote:[The popular https://github.com/cross-rs/cross[cross] tool used by https://github.com/actions-rs/cargo#cross-compilation[actions-rs/cargo] action doesn’t allow you to easily install additional packages or whatever needed for building your crate without creating, build and maintaining custom Docker images (https://github.com/cross-rs/cross/issues/281[cross-rs/cross#281]). This just impose unnecessary complexity and boilerplate.]
** No, you really don’t need any so-called “official” Docker image for gcc, nodejs, python or whatever you need… just install it using https://www.mankier.com/8/apk[apk] from https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages[Alpine packages]. It is fast, really fast!

* *Always up to date environment*
** The whole environment, all packages, are always installed directly from the Alpine Linux’s official repositories using {apk-tools} (Alpine’s package manager). There’s no intermediate layer that tends to lang behind with security fixes (such as Docker images). — You might be thinking, isn’t that slow? No, it’s faster than pulling a Docker image!
** No, you really don’t need any Docker image to get a stable build environment. Alpine Linux provides stable https://alpinelinux.org/releases/[releases] (branches); these get just (security) fixes, no breaking changes.

* *It’s simple and lightweight*
** You don’t have to worry about that on a hosted CI service, but still… This _action_ is written in ~220 LoC and uses only basic Unix tools (chroot, mount, wget, Bash, …) and {apk-tools} (Alpine’s package manager). That’s it.


== Parameters

=== Inputs

apk-tools-url::
URL of the apk-tools static binary to use.
It must end with `#!sha256!` followed by a SHA-256 hash of the file.
This should normally be left at the default value.
+
Default: _see link:setup-alpine.sh[]_

[[arch]] arch::
CPU architecture to emulate using https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/user/main.html[QEMU user space emulator].
Allowed values are: `x86_64` (native on x86_64), `x86` (native on x86_64), `aarch64` (native on aarch64), `armhf` footnote:[armhf is armv6 with hard-float.] (native on aarch64), `armv7` (native on aarch64), `loongarch64` footnote:[loongarch64 is available since v3.21.], `ppc64le`, `riscv64` footnote:[riscv64 is available since v3.20.], and `s390x`.
+
Default: _runner's native architecture_

branch::
Alpine branch (aka release) to install: `vMAJOR.MINOR`, `latest-stable`, or `edge`.
+
Example: `{alpine-latest}` +
Default: `latest-stable`

extra-keys::
A list of paths of additional trusted keys (for installing packages from the _extra-repositories_) to copy into _/etc/apk/keys/_.
The paths should be relative to the workspace directory (the default location of your repository when using the checkout action).
+
Example: `.keys/pkgs@example.org-56d0d9fd.rsa.pub`

extra-repositories::
A list of additional Alpine repositories to add into _/etc/apk/repositories_ (Alpine’s official _main_ and _community_ repositories are always added).
+
Example: `http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing`

mirror-url::
URL of an Alpine Linux mirror to fetch packages from.
+
Default: `http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine`

packages::
A list of Alpine packages to install.
+
Example: `build-base openssh-client` +
Default: _no extra packages_

shell-name::
Name of the script to run `sh` in the Alpine chroot that will be added to `GITHUB_PATH`.
This name should be used in `jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].shell` (e.g. `shell: alpine.sh {0}`) to run the step’s script in the chroot.
+
Default: `alpine.sh`

volumes::
A list of directories on the host system to mount bind into the chroot.
You can specify the source and destination path: `<src-dir>:<dest-dir>`.
The `<src-dir>` is an absolute path of existing directory on the host system, `<dest-dir>` is an absolute path in the chroot (it will be created if doesn’t exist).
You can omit the latter if they're the same.
+
Please note that _/home/runner/work_ (where’s your workspace located) is always mounted, don’t specify it here.
+
Example: `${{ steps.alpine-aarch64.outputs.root-path }}:/mnt/alpine-aarch64`


=== Outputs

root-path::
Path to the created Alpine root directory.

== History

This _action_ is an evolution of the https://github.com/alpinelinux/alpine-chroot-install[alpine-chroot-install] script I originally wrote for Travis CI in 2016.
The implementation is principally the same, but tailored to GitHub Actions.
It’s so simple and fast thanks to how awesome {apk-tools} is!
